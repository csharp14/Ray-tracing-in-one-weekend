# Ray-tracing-in-one-weekend

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project creates a simple ray tracer in C++.


THE CODE

Several custom header files are included. The vec3.h header file creates a class called vec3 which generates 3D vectors which can be used to create rays pointing to a specific point within the scene, for example. 


FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

This is still a WIP.


REQUIREMENTS

I used Visual Studio Code with the necessary C++ extensions. The compiler I used was GCC 12.2.0.
