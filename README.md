# Ray-tracing-in-one-weekend

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project creates a simple ray tracer in C++ following the book Ray Tracing in One Weekend.


THE CODE

Several custom header files are included. The vec3.h header file creates a class called vec3 which generates 3D vectors which can be used to create rays pointing to a specific point within the scene, for example. 


FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

The Ray Tracing The Next Week and Ray Tracing The Rest of Your Life books build on this project, and offer improvements to the code here.


REQUIREMENTS

I used Visual Studio Code with the necessary C++ extensions. The compiler I used was GCC 12.2.0.
